arg1="Degradation of Audio Quality/Introduction of Artifacts:
Stem splitting, while impressive, is not perfect. The algorithms
often introduce unwanted sonic artifacts, phase issues, and a
general degradation of the original audio's fidelity, especially
in complex or heavily processed mixes. This can manifest as
metallic sounds, watery effects, or a loss of punch.";

arg2="Loss of Original Intent/Artistic Vision:
When you split a mixed track, you're essentially
reverse-engineering the producer's and mixing
engineer's decisions. The balance, panning, and
effects applied to individual elements were done
with the full mix in mind. Separating them disrupts
this carefully crafted balance and can distort the
original artistic intent.";

arg3="Inaccurate Separation (Bleed/Crosstalk):
Even the best stem splitters struggle with perfect
isolation. You often end up with \"bleed\" from other
instruments in the supposedly isolated stem (e.g., drums
leaking into the vocal track, or bass in the kick drum).
This makes it difficult to process the individual
stems cleanly.";

arg4="Limited Creative Control (Post-Split):
While you gain \"access\" to individual elements, your
ability to creatively re-mix or process them is hampered
by the artifacts and inaccuracies of the split. You're
working with imperfect data, which limits the effectiveness
of further EQ, compression, or effects.";

arg5="Time-Consuming Cleanup:
After splitting, you often have to spend a significant
amount of time trying to clean up the individual stems,
removing artifacts, and addressing the bleed. This can
negate any perceived time-saving benefits of the
splitting process itself.";

arg6="Reliance on Imperfect Technology:
Over-reliance on stem splitters can hinder the
development of traditional mixing and mastering skills.
It encourages a shortcut approach rather than
understanding the nuances of how individual tracks
interact within a full mix.";

arg7="Copyright and Licensing Concerns (for certain uses):
If you're splitting commercial tracks for remixing or sampling,
there are significant legal and ethical considerations regarding
copyright and licensing, even if the technology allows it.
Using un-cleared stems can lead to legal issues.";

arg8="Lack of Dynamic Range and Depth:
The process of splitting often flattens the perceived
dynamic range and depth of the original recording. The
intricate interplay of instruments and their natural
reverberations within a well-mixed track can be lost or
severely diminished.";

arg9="Not a Substitute for Proper Multi-track Sessions:
Stem splitting should never be seen as an equivalent to
working with the original multi-track session. A multi-track
provides individual, unprocessed recordings of each instrument,
offering maximum flexibility and control for mixing and mastering.";

arg10="Ethical Considerations in Collaborative Workflows:
In professional settings, using stem splitters on a track
someone else mixed (without their explicit permission and
understanding) could be seen as disrespectful to their work
and can lead to misunderstandings or ethical conflicts
within a collaborative project.";

arg11="Yes. I'm to stupid to check this trigger thing.
You would have some nice buttoins instead of this slider.";
